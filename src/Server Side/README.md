# Object-Recognizer Server Side

## Libraries to install server side
- Flask
- Pillow
- google-cloud-vision

## Things to note
- `CallServer.py` is not actually run on the server. It was just used to test the server directly from a computer.
- Only 2 of the more than 20 images used to test are included.
- The credentials to the server are stored on separate ignored files and then called for obvious security reasons.
