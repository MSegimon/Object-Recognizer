## Team Name:
#### Whatever Inc.
## Overview:
#### Our project consists in making an android application that would automatically capture pictures, name the object and also give their location. This app is intended to help visually impaired people so that they can know what is in front of them by just opening the app. Our UI is made in a way that the user doesnâ€™t need to take the pictures. The app itself is going to take pictures and analyze them every couple of seconds by default.
## How to Build
#### Go to the misc folder, download the apk and install the app on your phone. After intalation open the app and everythign should be working perfectly. This app can only be used on a android smartphone that has a working camara.
